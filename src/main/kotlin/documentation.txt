  amov x: Moves to index x
  rmov x: Moves by x

length x: Sets length of the tape of the machine
  init x: writes a binary number on tape

   set x: writes number on tape (x can be 1 or 0)
    if x: if current number is x (x can be 1 or 0)
  ifst x: if state of machine is equal to x
   ifi x: if index of tape is equal to x
  ifnn  : if the current index is not null

  stat x: Sets a state for machine

  jmpi x: Jumps to line x in the programm but don't count empty line breaks they get removed
  rjmp x: Jumps by x in programm

   end  : ends programm is needed to run

   every command needs to be splittet by ";"
